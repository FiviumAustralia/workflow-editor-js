# workflow-editor-js
GUI Workflow editor that serializes to JSON.

## Installation
*This required [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed.*

1. `npm install -g bower` (if bower is not already installed)
2. `bower install`

## Usage

Take a look at index.html for comments as instructions.

## Caveats

- Only one workflow editor is allowed per page.
- When drawing a transition you must end on a "target" - i.e. a little dot anchor point, simply dragging to the middle of another stage is not enough.
