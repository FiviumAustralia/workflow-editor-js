# workflow-editor-js
GUI Workflow editor that serializes to JSON.

## Installation

`bower install`

## Usage

Take a look at index.html for comments as instructions.

## Caveats

- Only one workflow editor is allowed per page.
- When drawing a transition you must end on a "target" - i.e. a little dot anchor point, simply dragging to the middle of another stage is not enough.Ëœ
- Theres a distinct possibility that nothing will work.
